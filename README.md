# TonikwithaK  

### Welcome to the void.  

Code, music, and arena shooters.  
I break things. Then I fix them. Then I break them again.  

---

## Interests  
- MUSIC THEORY
- Arena FPS. Warfork, Quake, Reflex. Fast, brutal, and unforgiving.  
- Creative coding. Generative art. Math that makes things move.  
- Audio synthesis. FFT. Sounds as shapes, shapes as sounds.  
- Full-stack dev. Building things no one sees.  

---

## Currently  
- Writing a **Warfork map editor** because the tools we have suck.  
- Learning **Astro and Go** for fun (and pain).  
- Modding **Balatro** because sometimes you just have to.  
- Running **TARP (The Arena Revival Project)** because someone has to.  

---

## Collaboration  
- You a music or audio nerd? I'M IN!
- You have an FPS project? I’m listening.  
- You have an audio DSP idea? Let’s talk.  
- You have a weird project that makes no sense? I might be interested.  

---

## Contact  
- **Discord** – If you know, you know.  
- **Carrier pigeon** – No promises.  

---

## Fun Fact  
I once spent way too long thinking about **using Eigenvalues in VST-based spectral noise reduction**.  
Now I can’t stop.
